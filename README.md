# CuckooFilter

Pure Ruby implementation of the [Cuckoo Filter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf) - a probabilistic datastructure which is objectively better than Bloom Filters for set-membership queries.

## What the heck is a Cuckoo Filter?

It is a probabilistic data structure which is used to determine set-membership, i.e. finding out if a given element exists in a given set.

For practical uses think - checking if an item is present in a cache, if it is present in a database or YouTube trying to figure out if you have already watched some video before it is recommended to you.

It is closely related to Bloom Filters - but outshines them in performance and space efficiency. You can read more from the [original paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf) that introduced it in 2014. Yes, it is that young!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cuckoo_filter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cuckoo_filter

## Usage

```ruby
# Create a filter with 1024 (next power of 2) slots with each bucket holding 4
cf = CuckooFilter.make(size: 1000, kicks: 500, bucket_size: 4)
# => returns a CuckooFilter::CuckooFilter instance

# Insert an element into the filter
cf.insert("foo")
# => true

# Lookup the existence of an element
cf.lookup("foo")
# => true

cf.lookup("bar")
# => false

# Delete an existing element
cf.delete("foo")
# => true
```

## Frequenty Anticipated Questions

- Q: *Is this useful?*
  A: Yes, but mainly for academic purposes.
  
- Q: *Why not for practical purposes?*
  A: Because Ruby is not a performance-oriented language. It is made to be expressive, so it lacks a lot of low-level constructs needed to make this implementation fast and efficient enough.
  
- Q: *Then why did you make this?*
  A: For fun and education, of course!
  
- Q: *But why Ruby? Why not Go/Rust/Elixir/FooBar*
  A: Because why not? I like Ruby and I couldn't find a full blown implementation in it.
  
- Q: *Can I use it in a real project?*
  A: If it satisfies your criteria, then why not? Let me know if you do!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
